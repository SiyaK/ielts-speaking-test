Project Overview: IELTS Speaking Test Simulation
This project simulates an IELTS Speaking Test by allowing users to practice speaking English in real-time. It provides feedback based on IELTS assessment criteria: fluency, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

Technology Stack Used and Why
Tool/Service	Purpose	Reason for Selection
FastAPI	Backend framework	Lightweight, fast, and supports async operations.
Deepgram	Speech-to-text (transcription)	Provides real-time, accurate transcription.
OpenAI GPT-4	AI for feedback evaluation	Provides advanced language analysis capabilities.
ElevenLabs	Text-to-speech (audio responses)	Delivers high-quality AI-generated voice output.
WebSockets	Real-time communication	Enables live interaction without page reloads.
LiveKit (Optional)	Real-time audio/video streaming	Handles audio streaming efficiently.
Uvicorn	ASGI server to run FastAPI	Production-ready and supports concurrency.

Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Project
Step 1: Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python (>=3.10) – Required for compatibility with Deepgram v3.
Virtual Environment (venv) – Isolate dependencies.
FastAPI and dependencies – For backend operations.
Step 2: Clone the Project Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ielts-speaking-test.git
cd ielts-speaking-test
Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with system packages, create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies using the provided requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and populate it with your API keys:

makefile
Copy
Edit
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-api-key
VOICE_ID=your-elevenlabs-voice-id
Why this step?

These environment variables allow secure API access without hardcoding sensitive data in the code.
Step 6: Run the Backend Server
Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
Once the server is running, you should see output like:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Now, you can open the API documentation in your browser:

Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Why Uvicorn?

It's an ASGI server optimized for FastAPI, enabling asynchronous processing.
Step 7: Using the WebSocket for Real-Time Testing
Instead of manually uploading files, the project uses WebSockets for real-time audio streaming.

Use the LiveKit demo to stream audio from your microphone.
The backend transcribes it, analyzes it with GPT-4, and provides spoken feedback via ElevenLabs.
You can connect to the WebSocket at:

arduino
Copy
Edit
ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws/audio
Step 8: Testing the Application
Option 1: Using Swagger UI
Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.
Try the POST /process-audio/ endpoint by selecting a test audio file.
Option 2: Using Postman
Create a POST request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/process-audio/.
Use form-data to upload an audio file (.wav).
Option 3: Using WebSocket via JavaScript
You can create an HTML file to interact with the WebSocket.

Step 9: Deployment
Once the project works locally, deploy it to a cloud provider:

Backend: Deploy on Render or Railway
Frontend (Optional): Deploy on Vercel or Netlify
Step 10: Additional Features and Improvements
Once the core features are working, consider adding:

User Authentication: To track progress.
Progress Tracking: Store results for review.
UI Enhancements: Improve the frontend with React or Vue.js.
Why This Approach Was Chosen
Real-Time Interaction:

Using WebSockets allows real-time communication, making the experience closer to a real IELTS speaking test.
Asynchronous Processing:

FastAPI and Uvicorn handle requests efficiently, ensuring low latency in real-time responses.
State-of-the-Art AI Tools:

Deepgram: Offers high accuracy and real-time transcription.
GPT-4: Provides intelligent feedback on fluency and grammar.
ElevenLabs: Generates natural-sounding spoken feedback.
Scalability:

The modular architecture allows easy expansion for multi-user support.
Ease of Use:

FastAPI's built-in documentation (Swagger UI) simplifies API testing.
Common Errors and Troubleshooting
Error Message	Possible Solution
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'	Run the server from the project root.
FATAL ERROR: Deepgram object not callable	Downgrade to Deepgram SDK v2.12.0.
OpenAI API not supported	Update code to match OpenAI v1 API.
RuntimeWarning: coroutine was never awaited	Ensure async functions are awaited properly.
404 Not Found in Swagger	Verify endpoint names in app.py.
Conclusion
By following these steps, anyone should be able to set up and run the project successfully. The chosen tools and architecture ensure efficiency, scalability, and an engaging user experience.
