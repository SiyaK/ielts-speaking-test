Project Overview: IELTS Speaking Test Simulation
The IELTS Speaking Test Simulation project is designed to help users practice their English speaking skills in real-time. It evaluates their performance based on IELTS assessment criteria such as fluency, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. The system provides immediate feedback, allowing users to improve their speaking abilities through interactive conversations. The project utilizes cutting-edge AI technologies to analyze spoken input, offer suggestions, and deliver voice-based responses.

Technology Stack Used and Why
This project leverages a variety of technologies to ensure efficient real-time interaction and accurate feedback. FastAPI is used as the backend framework due to its lightweight nature, asynchronous capabilities, and speed. Deepgram provides high-quality speech-to-text transcription in real-time, ensuring accurate recognition of spoken input. OpenAI's GPT-4 model is used for analyzing responses and providing meaningful feedback based on IELTS standards. For delivering natural-sounding audio responses, ElevenLabs is utilized, and a specific Voice ID is chosen to personalize the user experience. To facilitate real-time communication, WebSockets are used to allow seamless interaction without reloading the page. The backend is powered by Uvicorn, an ASGI server optimized for FastAPI, ensuring efficient request handling and scalability.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directory structure:

│-- .env                     # API keys and configurations
│-- README.md                # Documentation for the project
The backend contains the FastAPI application, configuration files, utility scripts for processing speech input, and dependencies required to run the project. The frontend is housed within the backend to simplify deployment and access.

Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Project
Step 1: Prerequisites
To run the project successfully, ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system:

Python (>=3.10): Required for compatibility with Deepgram v3.
Virtual Environment (venv): Used to isolate dependencies and avoid conflicts.
FastAPI and related dependencies: For backend operations.
Step 2: Clone the Project Repository
To begin, clone the project repository and navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ielts-speaking-test.git
cd ielts-speaking-test
Step 3: Set Up Virtual Environment
Creating and activating a virtual environment ensures a clean workspace for dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
Step 4: Install Dependencies
Once inside the virtual environment, install the project dependencies using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
Step 5: Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and populate it with your API keys:

makefile
Copy
Edit
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your-deepgram-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-api-key
VOICE_ID=your-elevenlabs-voice-id
Using environment variables keeps API keys secure and configurable without modifying the source code.

Step 6: Run the Backend Server
Start the FastAPI backend server using Uvicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload
Upon successful execution, the server will be available at:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8000
You can access the API documentation at:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
Step 7: Access the Frontend
Once the backend is running, open the frontend interface in your browser by visiting:

ruby
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:8000/backend/frontend/index.html
This interface allows users to interact with the system in real time, receive transcriptions, and get feedback.

Step 8: Testing the Application
Users can test the system through the provided interface, which captures audio and sends it to the backend for processing. The system will provide real-time feedback and spoken responses.

Step 9: Deployment
Once the system is fully tested and operational, it can be deployed to cloud platforms such as:

Backend Deployment: Use Render or Railway to deploy the backend.
Frontend Deployment: Serve via the FastAPI backend or deploy to platforms like Vercel or Netlify.
Why This Approach Was Chosen
This project follows a real-time interaction approach, allowing users to experience an IELTS speaking test simulation in a natural way. The use of WebSockets enables dynamic communication, making the experience more immersive. FastAPI and Uvicorn ensure efficient processing and scalability, while Deepgram provides high-accuracy speech-to-text capabilities. OpenAI GPT-4 offers intelligent analysis and feedback, and ElevenLabs provides natural voice responses. The modular architecture allows for future expansion, including multi-user support and additional features.

Common Errors and Troubleshooting
Below are common issues users might face and their solutions:

Error Message	Possible Solution
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'	Ensure correct directory structure and imports.
Deepgram object is not callable	Update to Deepgram v3 and update function calls.
OpenAI API not supported	Update code to use the latest OpenAI API version.
RuntimeWarning: coroutine was never awaited	Ensure async functions are awaited correctly.
WebSocket connection refused	Ensure FastAPI server is running and accessible.
Conclusion
By following these steps, users should be able to set up, run, and test the IELTS Speaking Test simulation successfully. The combination of state-of-the-art AI tools and efficient backend technologies ensures an engaging and scalable solution. The project offers a practical way for users to enhance their speaking skills and receive constructive feedback in real time.
